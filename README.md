# JefBox

## Running App
- Will have to add Sencha repo to npmrc ([link](https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/7.0.0-CE/guides/using_systems/using_npm/npm_repo_access.html))
- From root dir:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start` (This will start the Node server)
  - Check the console output for what IP and port the server is running on
  - `cd ui`
  - `npm start` (This will build the UI code)
  - Navigate to IP and port of Node server
