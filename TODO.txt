Desktop:
- Add training video
- Add ability to remove teams from lobby
- When game is over, change the state to finished
- Add ability to delete answers... this will have to fire an event to the team that submitted the answer, so they can reanswer
- Add nuclear button, which submits empty answers for users that haven't submitted after the time limit
- Implement time limit

Phone:
- Inspect socket sleeping and reconnecting
- Answers are submitting while being typed
- Answers are erasing when typing in... but second time works
-- I think I know why this is... because every time someone submits or the game updates, the phone version refreshes the game
store... will need to think how the game store reloads for teams... make it more specific and listen for team only changes
- Deal with long answers and how to display
- Remove user from previous team if they rejoin game with a new team
